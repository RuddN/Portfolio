    <p class="txtbox">I started programming in fifth grade on KahnAcademy.org by learning their Javascript courses during a summer math practice course. I was bored of doing the math on Kahn Academy, and it turned out it had a very efficient system to earn energy points. Even if that's what attracted me to it originally, it's not why I stayed. I loved that I could create completely original programs that were completely born of my own ideas, but also take what someone else had created and create spin-offs by editing others' code. From the very start, I loved the collaboration involved with coding and the problem-solving nature of it. Even though I didn't continue much of it throughout the end of middle school, when I had the chance to take AP Computer Science in my sophomore year of high school, I did. I still remembered having a blast with the programs on Khan Academy and was excited to delve into more languages. I loved the class and rediscovered my love for programming and computer science through that class.

    <div class="divbox"><h4 class="hspacetall">The Status Quo:</h4>
    <p class="txtbox">This year I'm taking Advanced Computer Science, having completed AP Computer science last year, and I'm super excited for the year. I'm working on building my portfolio to get CIS credit from Inver Hills at the end of the year for my work in the class, and on top of the JavaScript I learned in 5th grade and the Java that the AP Computer Class involved, I'm working on learning HTML and CSS to work with websites. I enjoy using my coding knowledge to develop creative programs on my own time, and I'm also in the process of using it to create a web page for my Environmental Science Club. For me, computer programming is a hobby that I take up with my friends that understand. It's fun to spend time coding with people and continue the collaborative process I originally loved about programming, and I never learn more than when I'm discussing a problem with friends.

    <p class="txtbox">I'd love to going into a computer science-related major someday. To me, computer science is the future. I'd like to be a part of that future. What really sparks my interest in computer science is AI. I love AI theory. I'm currently reading a book on AI theory, The Fourth Age by Byron Reese, and it's fascinating. If I could be involved in developing and researching computer science someday that would be amazing. I love problem-solving, especially on a large scale. After starting to get partway through the book, I like that some of my favorite subjects in school still relate to the theoretical side of Computer Science and that I can apply what I've learned in other areas of my schooling to my programs.

    <div class="divbox"><h4 class="hspacetall">Interests:</h4>
    <p class="txtbox">I'd like to look into developing artificial therapists. As an introvert and a busy high school student, I know how hard it is to fit therapy visits into your schedule and how averse some people can be to talking to a human therapist. Personally, I'd feel extremely awkward talking to someone I didn't know all that well and entrusting them with all my deepest thoughts. If we, as a society, were able to develop Artificial Intelligence even farther than we have, we could offer therapy to teenagers and others through the internet or an app. Not only would it be much more accessible to have online therapists, but it could be more cost-effective, and less awkward for introverts like me. Though I don't have the necessary skill to create this program yet, and Artificial Intelligence isn't at the level it needs to be in order to be perfectly effective, I'm constantly learning and open to working with others to hopefully see it exist someday.
