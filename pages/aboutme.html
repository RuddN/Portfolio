    <p class="txtbox">I started programming in fifth grade on KahnAcademy.org learning their Javascript courses during a summer math practice course. I loved that I could create things and even though I didn't continue much of it throughout middle school, when I had the chance to take AP Computer Science I did. I still remembered having a blast with the programs on Khan Academy, and was excited to delve into more languages. I loved the class and rediscovered my love for programming. This year I'm taking Advanced Computer Science, having completed AP Computer science last year, and I'm super excited for the year.</p></div>
